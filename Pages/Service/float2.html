        <h1>injection</h1>
        <img class="img1" src="../../Assets/kits/inj2.jpg" alt="syringe" />
        <p>
          An injection (often and usually referred to as a "shot" in US English,
          a "jab" in UK English, or a "jag" in Scottish English and Scots) is
          the act of administering a liquid, especially a drug, into a person's
          body using a needle (usually a hypodermic needle) and a syringe. An
          injection is considered a form of parenteral drug administration; it
          does not involve absorption in the digestive tract. This allows the
          medication to be absorbed more rapidly and avoid the first pass
          effect. There are many types of injection, which are generally named
          after the body tissue the injection is administered into. This
          includes common injections such as subcutaneous, intramuscular, and
          intravenous injections, as well as less common injections such as
          intraperitoneal, intraosseous, intracardiac, intraarticular, and
          intracavernous injections. Injections are among the most common health
          care procedures, with at least 16 billion administered in developing
          and transitional countries each year. Of these, 95% are used in
          curative care or as treatment for a condition, 3% are to provide
          immunizations/vaccinations, and the rest are used for other purposes,
          including blood transfusions. The term injection is sometimes used
          synonymously with inoculation, but injection does not only refer to
          the act of inoculation. Injections generally administer a medication
          as a bolus (or one-time) dose, but can also be used for continuous
          drug administration. After injection, a medication may be designed to
          be released slowly, called a depot injection, which can produce
          long-lasting effects. An injection necessarily causes a small puncture
          wound to the body, and thus may cause localized pain or infection. The
          occurrence of these side effects varies based on injection location,
          the substance injected, needle gauge, procedure, and individual
          sensitivity. Rarely, more serious side effects including gangrene,
          sepsis, and nerve damage may occur. Fear of needles, also called
          needle phobia, is also common and may result in anxiety and fainting
          before, during, or after an injection. To prevent the localized pain
          that occurs with injections the injection site may be numbed or cooled
          before injection and the person receiving the injection may be
          distracted by a conversation or similar means. To reduce the risk of
          infection from injections, proper aseptic technique should be followed
          to clean the injection site before administration. If needles or
          syringes are reused between people, or if an accidental needlestick
          occurs, there is a risk of transmission of bloodborne diseases such as
          HIV and hepatitis. Unsafe injection practices contribute to the spread
          of bloodborne diseases, especially in less-developed countries. To
          combat this, safety syringes exist which contain features to prevent
          accidental needlestick injury and reuse of the syringe after it is
          used once. Furthermore, recreational drug users who use injections to
          administer the drugs commonly share or reuse needles after an
          injection. This has led to the development of needle exchange programs
          and safe injection sites as a public health measure, which may provide
          new, sterile syringes and needles to discourage the reuse of syringes
          and needles. Used needles should ideally be placed in a purpose-made
          sharps container which is safe and resistant to puncture. Some
          locations provide free disposal programs for such containers for their
          citizens.

          />
          A laptop computer or notebook computer, also laptop or notebook for
          short, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically
          have a clamshell form factor with a flat panel screen (usually 11–17
          in or 280–430 mm in diagonal size) on the inside of the upper lid, and
          an alphanumeric keyboard (typically QWERTY) on the inside of the lower
          lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable keyboard are often marketed
          as laptops or as having a "laptop mode". The internal hardwares are
          fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, and it's not
          uncommon for laptops to have a pointing device such as a trackpad or
          trackpoint. Many modern laptops also have a built-in webcam and even a
          touch screen display. Laptops run on both AC power supply and
          rechargeable battery pack, and can be folded shut for convenient
          storage and transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.
          Today, laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work
          (especially on business trips), in education, for playing games, web
          browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use.
          The names laptop and notebook reference the fact that the computer can
          be practically placed on (top of) the user's lap, and can be used
          similarly to a notebook. As of 2022, in American English, the terms
          laptop computer and notebook computer are used interchangeably; in
          other dialects of English, one or the other may be preferred. Although
          the terms notebook computers or notebooks originally referred to a
          specific size of laptop (originally smaller and lighter than
          mainstream laptops of the time), the terms have come to mean the same
          thing and notebook no longer refers to any specific size. Laptops
          combine many of the input/output components and capabilities of a
          desktop computer, including the display screen, small speakers, a
          keyboard, data storage device, pointing devices (such as a touch pad
          or pointing stick), with an operating system, a processor (Central
          processing unit (CPU)) and memory into a single unit. Most modern
          laptops feature integrated webcams and built-in microphones, while
          many also have touchscreens. Laptops can be powered either from an
          internal battery or by an external power supply from an AC adapter.
          Hardware specifications, such as the processor speed and memory
          capacity, significantly vary between different types, models and price
          points. Design elements, form factor and construction can also vary
          significantly between models depending on the intended use. Examples
          of specialized models of laptops include rugged notebooks for use in
          construction or military applications, as well as low production cost
          laptops such as those from the One Laptop per Child (OLPC)
          organization, which incorporate features like solar charging and
          semi-flexible components not found on most laptop computers. Portable
          computers, which later developed into modern laptops, were originally
          considered to be a small niche market, mostly for specialized field
          applications, such as in the military, for accountants, or traveling
          sales representatives. As portable computers evolved into modern
          laptops, they became widely used for a variety of purposes.

          />
          A tablet (also known as a pill) is a pharmaceutical oral dosage form
          (oral solid dosage, or OSD) or solid unit dosage form. Tablets may be
          defined as the solid unit dosage form of medicament or medicaments
          with suitable excipients. It comprises a mixture of active substances
          and excipients, usually in powder form, pressed or compacted from a
          powder into a solid dose. Tablets are prepared either by molding or by
          compression. The excipients can include diluents, binders or
          granulating agents, glidants (flow aids) and lubricants to ensure
          efficient tabletting; disintegrants to promote tablet break-up in the
          digestive tract; sweeteners or flavours to enhance taste; and pigments
          to make the tablets visually attractive or aid in visual
          identification of an unknown tablet. A polymer coating is often
          applied to make the tablet smoother and easier to swallow, to control
          the release rate of the active ingredient, to make it more resistant
          to the environment (extending its shelf life), or to enhance the
          tablet's appearance. Medicinal tablets were originally made in the
          shape of a disk of whatever color their components determined, but are
          now made in many shapes and colors to help distinguish different
          medicines. Tablets are often stamped with symbols, letters, and
          numbers, which enable them to be identified. Sizes of tablets to be
          swallowed range from a few millimetres to about a centimetre. The
          compressed tablet is the most popular dosage form in use today. About
          two-thirds of all prescriptions are dispensed as solid dosage forms,
          and half of these are compressed tablets. A tablet can be formulated
          to deliver an accurate dosage to a specific site; it is usually taken
          orally, but can be administered sublingually, buccally, rectally or
          intravaginally. The tablet is just one of the many forms that an oral
          drug can take such as syrups, elixirs, suspensions, and emulsions.

        <img class="imglion" src="../../Assets/Animals/lion3.png" alt="Lion" />
        <p>
          The term "big cat" is typically used to refer to any of the five
          living members of the genus Panthera, namely the tiger, lion, jaguar,
          leopard, and snow leopard, as well as the non-pantherine cheetah and
          cougar.[1][2] All cats descend from the Felidae family, sharing
          similar musculature, cardiovascular systems, skeletal frames, and
          behaviour. Both the cheetah and cougar differ physically from fellow
          big cats, and to a greater extent, other small cats. As obligate
          carnivores, big cats are considered apex predators, topping their food
          chain without natural predators of their own.[3][4] Native ranges
          include the Americas, Africa, and Asia; the range of the leopard and
          tiger also extends into Europe, specifically in Russia.[5]
